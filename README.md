# human-feelings-and-measurments-for-BCI
I believe that with BCI in future we could have cool full immersive console so what types of human senses we need to stimulate to achive that

english is not my first language, and i'm newbie for github so i just used deepseek for translation

Human Sensory Perception and Its Significance for Bidirectional BCI
BCI represents a new opportunity for the gaming community as "full immersion" gaming will become possible. To achieve this, we must first understand how to accomplish complete immersion.
What constitutes full immersion? It's the complete and simultaneous stimulation of all human senses without causing nausea, dizziness, or other defensive physiological reactions resulting from sensory mismatch - for example, when a person turns their head but receives no corresponding vestibular feedback.
So which senses need stimulation? All consciously perceived senses plus those processed by the brain at the unconscious reflex level (like breathing). Let's first list all known senses, then identify which we consciously feel versus those the brain monitors through unconditioned reflexes.
Vision
Hearing
Taste
Touch
Smell
Balance
Nociceptors (pain)
Mechanoreceptors
Proprioceptors
Chemoreceptors
Photoreceptors
Baroreceptors
Vestibular receptors
All these senses and receptors transmit information to the brain, and we need to stimulate precisely those neural pathways. But which senses should we stimulate, and which might be unsafe?
First, we must avoid stimulating senses tied to unconditioned reflexes without prior medical research and physician consultation, as this could impair breathing, circulation, and other vital reflexive functions.
We should also discuss measurement metrics for consciously perceptible senses. If you have specialized knowledge in this area, please comment below so I can add details. Let's help researchers develop new full-immersion systems. While none of the following claims absolute accuracy, I hope it assists in establishing proper measurement standards:
Vision - diopters, visual field, acuity, color gamut
Hearing - Hz, dB
Taste - S/Sw,So,Sa,B/Bt,U,F,M,P/Sp,St,C,Ca,A, intensity scales
Touch - dynamic pressure, thermal perception, texture
Smell - ISO 9235, ppm concentration
Balance - gravity, angular velocity, linear acceleration
Nociception - sharp pain, dull pain, itch
Mechanoreceptors - Pascals, milliNewtons, micrometers
Proprioceptors - muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, joint receptors
Chemoreceptors - trigeminal, cutaneous, dermal taste receptors
Photoreceptors - rods, cones
Baroreceptors - arterial, cardiopulmonary, other organs
